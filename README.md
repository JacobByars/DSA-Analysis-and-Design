What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this course we were making a program that would store course data into an appropritae structure and allow it to output the structure.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I considered what data structures would be appropriate. since it seemed like you would need to reupload the data structure every time you made the program i choose a vector as it was the most effient at this task. The drawbacks of the searches and the sorting being slower i deemed to be not as big as the problem with storing the data.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
The main roadblocks for this course was the way it was structured. With major assignment corrections being posted in annocments, and not to the assignment itself i found it difficult to know what needed to be done. I just did my best to get the assignements completed though. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
WIth the issues with the structure of the course i didnt get as much as i hoped for out of this class. It did however make me think of what data structures would be better for each task, and that is something i will incorporate into future programs i write. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
THe only thing i really leared in the course was to think of the ways the diffrent structures held data so besides choosing the approriate structue for the problem my style wont change much.
